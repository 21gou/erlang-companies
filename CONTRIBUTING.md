* New companies or updates are welcome provided the company meets the following requirements: 
   * The only requirement is that your company uses Erlang in production which is defined as follows:
     - A software was written by or for your company that is used internally and maintained. 
     - This __does__ __not__ include using an off-the-shelf product that happens to be written in Erlang.
   * If you are **not employed** by the company you are submitting you must cite strong evidence that a company is using
     Erlang. The rules above as to what constitutes using Erlang apply equally for this case.
